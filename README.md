# Declare all the things!

Configs I use on NixOS. They of course only work on my machines, so user discretion is advised.

* I use [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) to set up `$HOME` and such. 
* The [dconf2nix](https://github.com/gvolpe/dconf2nix) tool makes setting up GNOME a breeze.
